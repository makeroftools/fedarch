## 📋 Executive Summary

### What Is PRJ-020?

PRJ-020 is an AI-powered candidate evaluation pipeline for the WeOwnNet Interns Co-op program. The pipeline automates the screening, scoring, and ranking of intern applications using a combination of structured rules (n8n) and LLM evaluation (AnythingLLM + Qwen3.5-397B-A17B).

### MVP Status

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Pipeline Status** | ✅ Complete and operational |
| **Batches Processed** | Multiple (application reopened for additional candidates) |
| **Pipeline Runtime** | ~35 minutes per batch |
| **Hours Invested** | First-time pipeline build |

### W11-W12 Updates

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Application Status** | 🔄 REOPENED (additional candidates processed) |
| **Scoring Update** | @THY requested: 10 pts MAX for military AND/OR sports (combined, not stacked) |
| **Priority Change** | Prioritize "available to start now" candidates |
| **PostgreSQL Integration** | ⬜ TODO (PRJ-018 interns schema) |
| **Next Action** | Save all results to POP DB, document full process in replication document |

### Why This Matters

| Without PRJ-020 | With PRJ-020 |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Manual review: 20-30+ hours | ✅ ~35 minutes automated |
| Reviewer fatigue + bias drift | ✅ Consistent rubric for all |
| Surface-level screening | ✅ Deep LLM analysis (skills inflation, AI-generated content, cross-reference claims) |
| No audit trail | ✅ Full JSON output with every score + reasoning |
| One-time effort | ✅ Reusable pipeline for future cohorts |

    ├── applicants
    ├── applications
    ├── application_skills
    ├── application_evaluations
    └── application_ranks
```

### Infrastructure

| Component | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **n8n** | 18+ nodes, self-hosted on DOKS (ATL1, We Own Academy) |
| **AnythingLLM** | INT-P01, dedicated `intern-eval` workspace |
| **LLM** | Qwen3.5-397B-A17B |
| **Data Source** | WordPress Fluent Forms Pro REST API (`www.weown.xyz`) |
| **Resume Processing** | n8n Extract From File (PDF → text) |
| **Storage** | PostgreSQL POP DB (PRJ-018) — db-postgresql-atl1-weownnet |

### RAG Documents (INT-P01 intern-eval workspace)

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `RUBRIC.md` | Full scoring rubric — categories, points, criteria, examples |
| `JOB-DESCRIPTION.md` | Intern posting — role, stack, tracks, requirements |
| `SUCCESS-CRITERIA.md` | @THY directives, ideal candidate, priority stack |
| `SCORING-RULES.md` | Formulas, hard filters, JSON schemas |

---

## 📋 Evaluation Framework

### Hard Filters (Auto-DQ)

| Filter ID | Criteria | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **HF-1** | Country flag (IP geolocation) | Removed as DQ — flag only (unreliable) |
| **HF-2** | Not authorized to work in US | Required for co-op structure |
| **HF-3** | "Not interested" in one or more skills | Must be willing to learn all tracks |
| **HF-4/5** | Short answer too short (< 15 chars) | Effort indicator |

### LLM Evaluation Categories (Per Application)

| Category | Max Points | What Is Scored |
|----------|:----------:|----------------|
| Short Answer Quality | 25 | Thoughtfulness, specificity, effort |
| Resume & Links Evaluation | 25 | Skills claims vs evidence, GitHub quality |
| Attitude & Willingness to Learn | 20 | Growth mindset, coachability |
| Track Alignment & Consistency | 15 | Match between stated interest + resume |
| Communication Quality | 10 | Clarity, professionalism |
| Major Alignment | 5 | Relevant field of study |
| **LLM Total** | **100** | |

### Scoring Formula

#### Current (W11-W12 — @THY Changes)

```
Final = (Structured / structured_max × 35) + (LLM / 100 × 65) + Availability + Bonus

Where:
- Structured: Hard filters + skills matrix (35%)
- LLM: 6 categories (65%)
- Availability: +5 if "available to start now"
- Bonus: +10 MAX for military AND/OR sports (combined — not stacked)
- Max Possible: 115
```

### Bonus Criteria (@THY Priority Stack)

| Bonus | Points | How Detected | Important Note |
|-------|:------:|--------------|----------------|
| Military/Veteran | +10 | LLM scans resume for service indicators | **MAX 10 pts combined** |
| College Athlete | +10 | LLM scans resume for sports participation | **If candidate has BOTH, still only 10 pts total** |

> **⚠️ CRITICAL:** Bonus points are NOT stacked. If a candidate has both military service AND college athlete status, they receive +10 points MAX (not +20). This prevents double-dipping; the bonus is for service/commitment, not for accumulating traits.

### Priority Stack (THY-defined)

| Priority | Criteria | Weight |
|----------|----------|:------:|
| 1 | Attitude | 20 pts (LLM category) |
| 2 | Skill | 25 pts (LLM category) + 35% structured |
| 3 | Availability | +5 pts bonus (W11-W12 NEW) |
| 4 | Location | Tiebreaker (Denver, Las Vegas, Orlando, Nashville) |
| 5 | Bonus (Military/Sports) | +10 pts MAX combined (updated W11-W12) |

### Pass 3 Meta-Review Output

| Output | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Consistency check | Structured vs LLM scores |
| Skills inflation detection | LLM flags exaggeration |
| AI-generated content detection | LLM identifies AI-written answers |
| Red flags | 2-3 specific, concrete |
| Strengths | 2-3 specific, concrete |
| Overall narrative summary | Full candidate profile |
| Recommendation | ADVANCE / MAYBE / PASS with confidence level |
| Interview questions | 2-3 personalized per candidate |

---

## 📋 Technical Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Scoring split | 35% structured / 65% LLM | LLM handles nuanced evaluation |
| Track multiplier | None — equal skill weights | Prevents gaming; LLM handles track fit |
| HF-1 country check | Removed — flag only | IP geolocation unreliable |
| n8n keyword scan for bonuses | Removed | LLM scans resume instead |
| Variable structured_max | Per applicant | Form changed during live period — fair scoring |
| AnythingLLM mode | `query` not `chat` | Prevents context accumulation over 30+ calls |
| Resume extraction | n8n Extract From File (PDF) | Native, no external dependency |
| Error handling | try/catch + ignoreHttpStatusErrors | Failed LLM calls don't crash the batch |
| n8n task timeout | Increased to 1800s | Required for batch processing |

---

## 📋 Issues Encountered + Resolved

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|-----------|
| Fluent Forms API endpoint wrong | Corrected to `/submissions?form_id=8` not `/forms/8/entries` |
| Domain needed `www` prefix | `www.weown.xyz` not `weown.xyz` |
| Response field is JSON string | Added `JSON.parse(entry.response)` in parser |
| Skills matrix values are arrays | Access `[0]` — `["Strong experience"]` not `"Strong experience"` |
| Extract From File strips app data | Added Merge node to reunite resume text with app data |
| n8n Code node has no `fetch` | Used `this.helpers.httpRequest` instead |
| JSON expression escaping in HTTP node | Replaced HTTP Request node with Code node for LLM calls |
| n8n task runner 300s timeout | Set `N8N_RUNNERS_TASK_TIMEOUT=1800` |
| AnythingLLM chat history accumulation | Switched to `query` mode for batch processing |
| IP geolocation unreliable for location | Removed HF-1, flagged country mismatch for LLM review |
| Form changed during live period | Variable skill count handling with `-1` for missing skills |
