## 1. Executive Summary

### The One-Page Version

**The Problem:** We are spending approximately $4,500 per month on OpenRouter to use Claude Opus 4.6 — one of the most expensive AI models available — for every single task, no matter how simple. As we scale to 100 customers in 3 months and 1,000 by end of year, this cost would explode to $50,000-$750,000 per month. Our current approach is unsustainable.

**What We Found:** After researching 44 questions across privacy, model quality, AI gateways, inference frameworks, GPU hardware, multi-tenant architecture, and cost modeling, we identified a clear path forward.

**The Recommendation:** Deploy in two steps:

| Step | What | When | Monthly Cost | Savings |
|------|------|------|-------------|--------|
| **Step 1 (Quick Win)** | Deploy a smart routing gateway that sends simple questions to cheaper AI models instead of using the most expensive model for everything | This week | $1,070/mo | 76% savings ($3,430/mo) |
| **Step 2 (Full Solution)** | Add our own AI computer (GPU server) to run AI models ourselves, eliminating most cloud AI costs | Weeks 2-3 | $1,716/mo | 62% savings ($2,784/mo) |

**At Scale:**

| Scale | Current Approach (OpenRouter) | Recommended Approach | Savings |
|-------|------------------------------|---------------------|--------|
| 5 users (now) | $4,500/mo | $1,716/mo | $2,784/mo (62%) |
| 100 customers | $50,000-100,000/mo | $3,976/mo | $46,000-96,000/mo (93-97%) |
| 1,000 customers | $500,000-1,000,000/mo | $13,478/mo | $486,000-986,000/mo (97-99%) |

**12-Month Total:** Scaling from 5 users to 1,000 customers, the recommended approach costs approximately $95,000 over 12 months. The current approach would cost over $4,500,000. **That's $4.4 million in savings over one year.**

**Revenue Opportunity:** At recommended subscription pricing ($29-249/month per customer depending on tier), 1,000 customers would generate approximately $50,000/month in revenue against $13,478/month in infrastructure costs — an annual profit of approximately $438,000 from AI infrastructure alone.

**Privacy Bonus:** The recommended approach also gives us the strongest possible privacy and data sovereignty position. Customer data never leaves our infrastructure for most interactions, which strengthens our SOC2 and ISO 27001 compliance posture and differentiates us from competitors.

**All software in the recommended stack is free and open-source (FOSS).**

## 2. The Problem — Why This Evaluation Exists

### What We Spend Today

We currently use a service called OpenRouter to connect our AI application (AnythingLLM) to Claude Opus 4.6, an AI model made by Anthropic. Here is our actual spending:

| Date | Amount | Days Between Top-Ups | Spending Rate |
|------|--------|---------------------|---------------|
| January 9, 2026 | $1,000 | — | — |
| January 18, 2026 | $777 | 9 days | $86/day |
| February 1, 2026 | $500 | 14 days | $36/day |
| February 7, 2026 | $500 | 6 days | $83/day |
| February 10, 2026 | $500 | 3 days | $167/day |
| February 15, 2026 | $500 | 5 days | $100/day |
| February 17, 2026 | $500 | 2 days | $250/day |
| **Total** | **$4,277** | **40 days** | **$107/day average** |

The trend is **accelerating**. Our most recent spending rate was $250 per day — that would be $7,500 per month.

### Why It's So Expensive

Two reasons:

1. **We use the most expensive AI model for everything.** Claude Opus 4.6 costs $15 per million input words and $75 per million output words. That's like hiring a top surgeon for every medical question — even the ones a nurse could answer perfectly well.

2. **The cost scales directly with every new customer.** Each customer we onboard uses our AI credits. More customers = proportionally more cost. There are no volume discounts that change this math significantly.

### What Happens If We Don't Change

| Customers | Monthly OpenRouter Cost | Annual Cost |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------|
| 5 (now) | $4,500 | $54,000 |
| 20 | $18,000 | $216,000 |
| 100 | $50,000-100,000 | $600,000-1,200,000 |
| 500 | $250,000-500,000 | $3,000,000-6,000,000 |
| 1,000 | $500,000-1,000,000 | $6,000,000-12,000,000 |

**At 100 customers, our AI costs alone would be $50,000-100,000 per month.** Unless our subscription pricing is extremely high, this makes the business model unviable.

### Who Requested This Evaluation

This evaluation was initiated by CEO Stef and prioritized as high-urgency by CFO Tyler due to the accelerating OpenRouter spend. The goal: find a sustainable, private, and cost-effective approach to AI infrastructure that works at scale.

## 3. How Our Current Setup Works (Plain English)

### The Simple Version

When someone uses our AI application (AnythingLLM), here's what happens:

```
You type a question
    ↓
AnythingLLM (our app, running on our servers) receives it
    ↓
AnythingLLM sends your question to OpenRouter (a middleman company)
    ↓
OpenRouter sends it to Anthropic (the company that made Claude)
    ↓
Claude thinks about it and creates a response
    ↓
The response travels back: Anthropic → OpenRouter → AnythingLLM → You
```

### What This Means for Privacy

Your question travels through **three different companies' computers**:
1. Ours (AnythingLLM on DigitalOcean)
2. OpenRouter's servers
3. Anthropic's servers

Each of these companies can potentially see the full text of every question and answer. While we have enabled privacy settings (Zero Data Retention, training disabled), the data still physically passes through their systems.

### What This Means for Cost

Every single question and answer costs money. The cost depends on:
- **How many words are in the question** (including all the background context, documents, and conversation history AnythingLLM sends along)
- **How many words are in the answer**
- **Which AI model we use** (Claude Opus 4.6 is the most expensive)

We currently send ALL questions to the most expensive model, regardless of whether the question is "What time is it?" or "Analyze these 50 legal documents and create a merger strategy."

## 4. The Seven Options We Evaluated

We evaluated seven different approaches to providing AI to our team and customers. Here's what each one means in plain English:

### Option A: Stay on OpenRouter (What We Do Now)

**How it works:** Keep everything as-is. Every question goes through OpenRouter to Claude Opus 4.6.

**Like:** Ordering every meal from the most expensive restaurant in town, even when you just want a sandwich.

### Option B: Add Smart Routing (Gateway + Cloud AI)

**How it works:** Add a "traffic controller" (called a gateway) that looks at each question and sends it to the right AI model. Simple questions go to cheap models. Complex questions go to expensive models. We still use cloud AI companies, but we're smarter about which one handles what.

**Like:** Having a hostess who directs you to the sandwich shop for lunch and the fine restaurant only for special occasions.

### Option C: Run Our Own AI (Self-Hosted, Free Software) ✅ RECOMMENDED

**How it works:** We rent a powerful computer (a GPU server) from DigitalOcean for $1,433/month and run free, open-source AI models on it. This computer handles most questions. For the rare very complex question that needs the absolute best AI, we still send it to Claude as a backup.

**Like:** Hiring your own chef for daily meals, but keeping the fancy restaurant's number for truly special occasions.

### Option D: Run Our Own AI (Self-Hosted, Paid Software)

**How it works:** Same as Option C, but using paid management software (Portkey, $500-2,000/month) instead of free software (LiteLLM).

**Like:** Same as Option C, but hiring a kitchen manager too.

### Option E: Hybrid (Cloud + Office Hardware)

**How it works:** Same as Option C, plus we buy physical computer hardware (like a Mac Studio) for our offices. The office hardware handles some requests, especially for internal team use.

**Like:** Having your own chef (cloud GPU) plus a well-stocked kitchen at home (office hardware) for everyday cooking.

### Option F: Pay-Per-Use Computers (Serverless)

**How it works:** Instead of renting a dedicated computer 24/7, we rent computer time only when someone asks a question. The computer "wakes up" for each request.

**Like:** Calling a private chef for each individual meal. No monthly salary, but they take 30-120 seconds to arrive each time, and it gets expensive if you eat a lot.

### Option G: Let HuggingFace Manage It

**How it works:** A company called HuggingFace rents us a computer and manages the AI software on it. We don't manage the hardware ourselves.

**Like:** Hiring a catering company instead of your own chef. Easier to manage but more expensive.

## 5. Cost Comparison — The Numbers

### Monthly Cost at Every Scale

| Option | 5 Users (Now) | 100 Customers | 1,000 Customers |
|--------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **A: OpenRouter (current)** | $4,500 | $75,000 | $750,000 |
| **B: Gateway + Cloud APIs** | **$1,070** | $6,370 | $60,880 |
| **C: Self-Hosted FOSS** ✅ | $1,993 | **$3,976** | **$13,478** |
| **D: Self-Hosted Paid** | $2,333 | $4,236 | $15,000 |
| **E: Hybrid** | $2,733 | $4,766 | $15,368 |
| **F: Serverless** | $1,290 | $8,990 | $63,230 |
| **G: HF Endpoints** | $5,120 | $10,250 | $49,730 |

### Where the Money Goes (Option C at 100 Customers)

| Cost Item | Monthly Amount | What It Is |
|-----------|:---:|------------|
| GPU Server Rental | $2,866 | Two powerful computers (AMD MI300X) from DigitalOcean that run our AI models |
| Smart Routing Gateway | $100 | Software (LiteLLM) that directs questions to the right AI model |
| Monitoring Dashboard | $30 | Software (Langfuse) that tracks how well our AI is performing |
| Cloud AI Backup | $500 | Claude Opus for the ~10% of questions that need the absolute best AI |
| Supporting Infrastructure | $80 | Databases, caching, load balancers |
| Staff Time (est.) | $400 | ~8 hours/month of maintenance at $50/hour |
| **Total** | **$3,976** | |

### 12-Month Total Cost (Scaling from 5 to 1,000 Customers)

| Option | 12-Month Total | vs OpenRouter Savings |
|--------|:---:|:---:|
| A: OpenRouter | $4,500,000+ | — |
| B: Gateway + Cloud | $365,000 | $4,135,000 (92%) |
| **C: Self-Hosted FOSS** ✅ | **$95,000** | **$4,405,000 (98%)** |
| D: Self-Hosted Paid | $110,000 | $4,390,000 (98%) |
| E: Hybrid | $105,000 | $4,395,000 (98%) |
| F: Serverless | $380,000 | $4,120,000 (92%) |
| G: HF Endpoints | $300,000 | $4,200,000 (93%) |

### Why Option C Wins on Cost

The key insight: **running your own AI computer has a fixed monthly cost regardless of how many questions are asked.** Whether 5 people or 500 people send questions, the computer costs the same $1,433/month. This means the more customers we have, the cheaper it gets per customer.

| Scale | OpenRouter Cost Per Customer | Self-Hosted Cost Per Customer |
|-------|:---:|:---:|
| 5 users | $900/user | $343/user |
| 100 customers | $750/customer | **$40/customer** |
| 1,000 customers | $750/customer | **$13/customer** |

At 1,000 customers, our AI infrastructure cost is approximately **$13 per customer per month.** On OpenRouter, it would be **$750 per customer per month.** That's a 58× difference.

## 6. Privacy & Security Comparison

### Why Privacy Matters for WeOwnNet

Privacy and data sovereignty are **core selling points** for our customers. We promise private AI instances. If customer data is being sent to third-party AI companies, that promise is weakened.

We are also pursuing SOC2 Type II, ISO 27001, ISO 42001, and NIST CSF compliance. How we handle AI data directly impacts these certifications.

### Where Does Customer Data Go?

| Option | Your Data Goes To | Who Can See It |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| **A: OpenRouter** | Our servers → OpenRouter → Anthropic | 3 companies |
| **B: Gateway + Cloud APIs** | Our servers → Anthropic (direct) | 2 companies |
| **C: Self-Hosted** ✅ | **Our servers only (90% of requests)** | **1 company (us)** |
| **D: Self-Hosted Paid** | Same as C | 1 company (us) |
| **E: Hybrid** | Same as C | 1 company (us) |
| **F: Serverless** | Our servers → Serverless provider | 2 companies |
| **G: HF Endpoints** | Our servers → HuggingFace | 2 companies |

### Privacy Ratings

| Factor | A: OpenRouter | B: Gateway+Cloud | C: Self-Hosted ✅ |
|--------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Data stays on our computers | ❌ No | ❌ No (most requests) | ✅ Yes (90%+ of requests) |
| Third-party sees our prompts | ✅ Yes (2 companies) | ✅ Yes (1 company) | ⚠️ Rarely (backup only) |
| Third-party certifications | OpenRouter: None | Anthropic: SOC2 | Not needed (we control it) |
| We control data retention | ❌ No | ⚠️ Partially | ✅ Fully |
| Can tell customers "data stays private" | ❌ Weak claim | ⚠️ Moderate claim | ✅ **Strong claim** |
| Compliance (SOC2/ISO 27001) | 🔴 Hard | 🟡 Medium | 🟢 **Easiest** |

### What We Can Tell Customers

**With Option A (current):**
> "Your AI interactions are processed through a third-party routing service and a third-party AI provider. Both may temporarily process your data."

**With Option C (recommended):**
> "Your AI interactions are processed entirely on WeOwnNet's private infrastructure. Your prompts and responses never leave our servers. No third-party AI company receives, processes, or stores your data. Your data is never used for AI model training."

This is a **significant competitive advantage** for winning privacy-conscious customers.

### Compliance Impact

| Certification | Option A (OpenRouter) | Option C (Self-Hosted) |
|--------------|:---:|:---:|
| SOC2 Type II | 🔴 Hard — OpenRouter has no certifications, creating supply chain gaps | 🟢 Easy — all data on our infrastructure, full audit trail |
| ISO 27001 | 🔴 Hard — two uncertified third parties in the supply chain | 🟢 Easy — simplified data flow, full lifecycle control |
| ISO 42001 | 🟡 Medium — Anthropic handles model governance | 🟡 Medium — we take on model governance responsibility |
| NIST CSF | 🔴 Hard — limited visibility into third-party processing | 🟢 Easy — complete visibility and control |

## 8. Break-Even Analysis — When Does Each Option Pay Off?

### When Does Self-Hosting Become Cheaper?

Self-hosting requires renting a GPU computer ($1,433/month). This is a fixed cost — you pay it whether you use it a lot or a little. Cloud AI (OpenRouter, Anthropic) charges per question/word, so cost scales with usage.

**The break-even point is where the fixed cost of self-hosting equals the per-use cost of cloud AI.**

| Comparison | Break-Even Point | Our Current Position |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Self-hosted vs All-Opus on OpenRouter | $1,433/mo in cloud spend | ✅ **We passed this on day 1** ($4,500/mo) |
| Self-hosted vs Smart-Routed Cloud APIs | ~$1,900/mo in cloud spend | ✅ Passed at ~15 users |
| Self-hosted vs Together AI (cheapest cloud) | ~$2,600/mo in cloud spend | ✅ Passed at ~20 users |

**We are already well past the break-even point.** Self-hosting is cheaper than every cloud option at our current usage level. As we add customers, the savings compound dramatically.
